autopybook is a simple standlone web notebook with autosave written in Python.

To use it just run

    python run.py

And make sure that the current user has write permissions on the current directory.

Notes will be saved in separate files according to the chosen id.

I like to keep my autopybook folder inside my Dropbox folder so my notes are automatically backed up.
