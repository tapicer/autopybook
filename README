autopybook is a simple standlone web notebook with autosave written in Python.

To use it just run

```
python run.py
```

And make sure that the current user has write permissions on the current directory.

Notes will be saved in separate files according to the chosen id.

I like to keep my autopybook folder inside my Dropbox folder so my notes are automatically backed up.
